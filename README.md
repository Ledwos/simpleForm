# Simple HTML Form

- As the title suggests, just a simple HTML form with basic styling.

### Why are there two 'Age' inputs?

- task asked for min max value validation, `type="number"` was used as `type="text"` does not have min max attributes.

- the other age field is `type="text"` for text/number validation. `type="number"` doesn't allow you to enter letters (except e) in the first place so you wouldn't have this error, hence a second age field.

- No user story about a `<select>` element but it was in the screenshot so it was added just in case :)
